 Explain basic structure of a c program with an example.

#include<stdio.h> // preprocessor directive to include
the standard input-output library

         // Global
Declaration (if any)       

        // Functional
prototype (optional declaration of function before main)


int main() {    //
main function, Starting point of program

        // variable
declarations (local to main)

return 0; //return statement indicating the program ended
successfully

}

// other function can be define here

Example:-

#include <stdio.h>
int main(){
printf(“Hello,Everyone..”);
}


 


 


2} What are the different types data types in c programming?

Data types are divided in several parts

Basic data types


Int – This data type is used to store integer.


char – This data type is used to store single characters.


float -  This data
type is used to store floating point number.


double - This data type is used to store double precision,
floating point number.



Derived Data Types:-


Array – Arrays are used to store a collection of elements
of  the same data type.


Pointer – Pointers are used to store address of another
variable.


Structure – Structures are used to store a collection of
related data items.


Union – Union are used to store different types of data in
the same memory location.


 


3} Define macro. Write a c program to demonstrate user
defined macro


macro – It is a block of a code which will be replaced by
the value of the macro

        Macro are
defined using the ‘#define’.



#include<stdio.h>
#define PI 3.14159
#define GREETING "Wipro Training"
#define SQUARE(x) ((x) * (x))
#define CIRCLE_AREA(r) (PI * (r) * (r))
int main()
{
printf("%s\n",GREETING);
printf("Value of PI : %f\n",PI);
        int number=6;
printf("Square of %d is %d\n",number,SQUARE(number));
 double radius=3.0;
printf("Area of Circle with the radius %lf :
%.2f\n",radius,CIRCLE_AREA(radius));
return 0;
}




4} Write a c program to demonstrate printf(),scanf(),fgets()
and puts() with an example.


#include <stdio.h>

int main() {

    char name[50];
     int age;
    // Get user's name
using fgets()       
printf("Enter the Name :\n");
fgets(name,sizeof(name),stdin);
   // Display user
input using puts()
printf("Name :\n");
        puts(name);

    // Get user's age
using scanf()

    printf("Enter
your age: ");
   
scanf("%d", &age);

    // Display user
information using printf()

    printf("\n
Your details:\n");

    printf("Name:
%s\n", name);
    printf("Age:
%d\n", age);

  return 0;

}
